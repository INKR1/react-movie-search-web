# Movie application 

## Description

This is a simple movie search web app where user enters movie name or series and using popular website OMDb API (which is a RESTful web service) obtain information, all content and images on the site. They have kindly made their dataset publicly available through REST API.
Some movies do not have poster images. Instead I used a placeholder.
